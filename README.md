# ArcVision
## Obstacle Detection and Object Recognition Device for People with Vision Impairments
_In this project, our aim is to create a wearable device equipped with a camera and a button, designed to be worn on the chest like **Iron Man’s arc reactor**. The camera rapidly captures images of the environment, which are then analyzed by the microcontroller to detect obstacles and generate instructions to avoid them. These instructions are conveyed to the user via sound signals._

### Functional Requirements
- The user can receive a description of the environment by holding down the button on the device.
- The device should be large enough to be easily located by touch.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The battery should last for at least 12 hours.
- The microcontroller should generate instructions within one second.

### Tasks List
- [ ] Learn openCV
- [ ] Code the algorithm
- [ ] Select Hardware
