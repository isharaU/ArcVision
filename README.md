# ArcVision
## Obstacle Detection and Object Recognition Device for People with Vision Impairments
_Arc Vision empowers visually impaired individuals through two core components: the Arc Vision App and Glove. The app, built with React Native Expo, connects seamlessly to the Glove, equipped with sonar sensors and an action button. Users can capture images, receive image recognition descriptions, and send quick emergency alerts. With Wi-Fi connectivity and customizable settings, Arc Vision enhances independence and security for the visually impaired._

## Usability Survey
_The usability of this device with a smartphone may be difficult to assess because visually impaired people may not be able to use a smartphone. To address this challenge, I conducted a survey to gather feedback from people who know visually impaired people.

## Overview
#### Project Goals
ArcVision's main objective is to:
 + Create seamless Wi-Fi connectivity between the mobile app and the Arc Vision Glove.
 + Enable users to capture images using the app's camera functionality.
 + Implement image recognition technology to generate textual descriptions of captured images.
 + Facilitate rapid location-based emergency alerts to pre-saved mobile contacts.
 + Equip the Arc Vision Glove with a sonar sensor to detect obstacles.
 + Ensure real-time communication between the Glove and the mobile app for obstacle detection and emergency alerts.
 + Enhance the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals by combining technology and real-time communication.

## Key Features

1. **Seamless Connectivity**
   - The Arc Vision App initiates a Wi-Fi connection to the Arc Vision Glove, establishing a seamless link between the user and the wearable device.

2. **Real-time Obstacle Detection**
   - Equipped with sonar sensors and video camera modules, Arc Vision detects obstacles in real time, providing users with the assurance they need to navigate their surroundings confidently.

3. **Immediate Feedback**
   - Upon detecting obstacles, Arc Vision offers immediate feedback through dual channels. A Bluetooth connection pairs with earphones to deliver auditory alerts regarding obstacle presence and location. Simultaneously, a built-in vibrator provides tactile alerts, enhancing user awareness.

4. **User-Friendly Design**
   - Compact and Portable: The Arc Vision Glove is designed for convenience, with a compact form factor measuring between 20 to 30 cm in length, making it easy to carry and handle.

5. **Enhanced Mobility and Independence**
   - By providing reliable obstacle detection and immediate feedback, Arc Vision empowers individuals with vision impairments to move independently, boosting their confidence and overall quality of life.

Arc Vision is dedicated to revolutionizing the daily experiences of visually impaired individuals, allowing them to navigate the world with newfound independence and security.
