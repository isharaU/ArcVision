# ArcVision
## Obstacle Detection and Object Recognition Device for People with Vision Impairments
_ArcVision is a device designed to enhance the mobility and safety of individuals with vision impairments. This innovative wand-like device empowers users to navigate their surroundings confidently by providing real-time obstacle detection and feedback._

## Overview
#### Project Goals
ArcVision's main objective is to:
 + **Enhance Independence:** <br> _Offer an alternative to traditional white canes for the visually impaired, promoting greater autonomy and mobility._
 + **Obstacle Detection**: <br> _Utilize cutting-edge technology, including sonar sensors and a camera module, to detect obstacles in the user's path._
 + **Immediate Feedback:** <br> _Provide instant feedback through Bluetooth earphones and a built-in vibrator, ensuring users are aware of obstacles in their proximity._
 + **Ground Level Detection:** <br> _Incorporate IR sensors on the device's lower section to identify ground-level obstacles or changes._
#### How it Works
ArcVision combines sophisticated hardware and software components:
 + **Sonar Sensor:** <br> _Utilizes sound waves to measure distances, identifying obstacles in front of the user._
 + **Camera Module:** <br> _Captures images of the user's surroundings, allowing for more detailed obstacle recognition._
 + **Bluetooth Connectivity:** <br> _Sends obstacle alerts to a paired Bluetooth earphone for auditory feedback._
 + **Vibrator Feedback:** <br> _Offers tactile feedback through a built-in vibrator._
 + **IR Sensors:** <br> _Detects ground-level obstacles or changes to ensure safe navigation._
#### Impact
_ArcVision has the potential to significantly improve the daily lives of individuals with vision impairments. It provides a dependable and user-friendly means of detecting obstacles, empowering them to confidently navigate their environment. This not only reduces the likelihood of accidents but also elevates their overall quality of life._

## Features
#### ArcVision has a variety of features to help individuals with visual impairments in their daily lives.
 1. **Obstacle Detection** <br>
 _ArcVision employs sonar sensors and a video camera module to detect obstacles in real time. Users can confidently move through their environment with the assurance that potential obstructions will be identified._
 1. **Immediate Feedback** <br>
 _Upon detecting an obstacle, ArcVision provides immediate feedback to the user through two distinct channels. An integrated Bluetooth connection allows the device to communicate with a paired earphone, delivering auditory alerts about the presence and location of obstacles. In addition to auditory feedback, ArcVision features a built-in vibrator that provides tactile alerts, enhancing the user's awareness of obstacles._
 1. **Ground Level Block Detection** <br>
 _To further enhance safety, ArcVision includes two Infrared (IR) sensors on the lower section of the body. These sensors are dedicated to identifying ground-level obstacles or changes in terrain, ensuring a smooth and obstacle-free journey._
 1. **User-Friendly Design** <br>
 _Compact and Portable: The device is compact, measuring between 20 to 30 cm in length, making it easy to carry and handle._
 1. **Enhanced Mobility and Independence** <br>
_By providing reliable obstacle detection and immediate feedback, ArcVision empowers individuals with vision impairments to move independently, boosting their confidence and overall quality of life._

## Usage
#### ArcVision is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, ensuring individuals with vision impairments can easily incorporate it into their daily routines. Here's how to use ArcVision effectively
+  **Power On** <br>
_Press and hold the power button to turn on ArcVision. You will hear an initialization sound, indicating that the device is ready to use._
+  **Hold Comfortably** <br>
_Hold ArcVision like a wand, with the grip in your hand. Ensure that the camera module is facing forward, allowing it to capture your surroundings._
+  **Start Walking** <br>
_As you walk, ArcVision continuously scans the environment using its sonar sensor and camera module._
+  **Power Off** <br>
 _To conserve battery life, simply press and hold the power button again to turn off ArcVision when you're done using it._
+  **Maintenance** <br>
  _It's essential to keep the camera lens and sensors clean for optimal performance. Regularly wipe them with a soft, lint-free cloth._
